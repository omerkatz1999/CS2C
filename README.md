# CS2C

This is a Data Structures and Algorithms class taken in c++.
Each project is themed around a different data struxture/algorithm.


Data structures covered in this class include: vectors, lists, stack, queues, trees (binary, bst, AVL, Splay), graphs, hash tables/maps.

AlgorithmsL: all major sorting algorithms, Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's, dynamic programming (knap sack problem, fibbonaci, etc)
